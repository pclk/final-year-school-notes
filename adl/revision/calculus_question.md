1. Differentiate x5 with respect to x.
y = x^5

dy/dx = 5x^4
This uses power rule

2. Differentiate 10x2 with respect to x.
y = 10x^2
dy/dx = 2 * 10x
dy/dx = 20x

3. Differentiate 20x-4 + 9.
y = 20x - 4 + 9
dy/dx = 20x^1-1 -0 + 0
The x value is zeroed out by power rule, and 4 and 9 is zeroed out due to constant rule.
dy/dx = 20

3. Differentiate 20x^-4 + 9.
y = 20x^-4 + 9.
-4 bring down via power rule, x^-5 via power rule, 9=0 via constant rule.
dy/dx = -4 * 20 * x^-5 + 0
dy/dx = -80x^-5

4. Differentiate ln(10).
y = ln(10)
dy/dx = 1/10
dy/dx = 0 due constant rule.

User's attempt: Differentiate sin(3x+5)
y = sin(3x+5)
dy/dx = cos(3)
This is due to sin(x) being cos(xh and 3x^1-1 due to power rule and 3=0 due to constant rule


Answer Differentiate sin(3x+5)
<!---->
<!-- Solution: Say, y = sin (3x+5) -->
<!---->
<!-- dy/dx = d[sin(3x+5)]/dx -->
<!---->
<!-- = cos (3x+5) d(3x+5)/dx [ By chain rule] -->
<!---->
<!-- = cos (3x+5) [3] -->
<!---->
<!-- y’ = 3 cos (3x+5) -->
<!---->
<!-- d[sin(3x+5)]/dx = 3 cos (3x+5) -->

Try again: Differentiate sin(3x+5)
y = sin(3x+5)
u = 3x+5
y = sin(u)
Differentiate outer function
dy/dx = cos(u)
du/dx = 3
apply chain rule
dy/dx = cos(3x+5) * 3
dy/dx = 3cos(3x+5)


5. Differentiate cos(7x).
y = cos(7x)
u = 7x
y = cos(u)
dy/du = -sin(u)
du/dy = 7
dy/dx = -sin(7x) * 7
dy/dx = -7sin(7x)

6. Differentiate (2x+1)^3.
y = (2x+1)^3
u = 2x+1
y = (u)^3
dy/dx = 3u^2
du/dy = 2
dy/dx = 3(2x+1)^2 * 2
dy/dx = 6(2x+1)^2

7. Differentiate sin(x^2).
y = sin(x^2)
u = x^2
y = sin(u)
dy/du = cos(u)
du/dx = 2x
dy/dx = cos(x^2)*2x
dy/dx = 2xcos(x^2)

8. Differentiate 5e^(2x).
y = 5e^(2x)
u = 2x
dy/du = 5e^(u)
du/dx = 2
dy/dx = 5e^(2x) * 2
dy/dx = 10e^(2x)

9. Differentiate ln(4x+3).
y = ln(4x+3)
u = 4x+3
dy/du = 1/u
du/dx = 4
dy/dx = ( 1/4x+3 ) * 4
dy/dx = 4(1/4x+3)

10. Differentiate sqrt(9x).
y = sqrt(9x)
y = (9x)^1/2
u = 9x
y = u^1/2
dy/du = 1/2u^-1/2
du/dx = 9
dy/dx = 9/2(9x)^(-1/2)
power then multiplication
dy/dx = 9/2(1/3x^1/2)
dy/dx = 3/2x^1/2

6. Differentiate tan2x.
y = tan2x
y = (tan x)^2
u = tanx
dy/du = 2u
du/dx = sec^2x
dy/dx = 2(tanx)*sec^2x

7. Compute the derivative of f(x) = sin2x.
y = sin2x
y = (sinx)^2
u = sinx
y = u^2
dy/du = 2u
du/dx = cosx
dy/dx = 2(sinx) *cosx
