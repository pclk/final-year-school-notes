1. Differentiate x5 with respect to x.

Solution: Given, y = x5

On differentiating w.r.t we get;

dy/dx = d(x5)/dx

y’ = 5x5-1 = 5x4

Therefore, d(x5)/dx = 5x4

2. Differentiate 10x2 with respect to x.

Solution: y = 10x2

y’ = d(10x2)/dx

y’ = 2.10.x = 20x

Therefore, d(10x2)/dx = 20 x

3. Differentiate 20x-4 + 9.

Solution: y = 20x-4 + 9

y’ = d(20x-4 + 9)/dx

y’ = d(20x-4)/dx + d(9)/dx

y’ = -4.20.x-4-1+0

y’ = -80x-5

Therefore, d(20x-4 + 9)/dx = -80x-5

4. Differentiate ln(10).

Solution:

Since ln(10) is a constant, the derivative of ln(10) with respect to the variable “x” is 0.

Rules of Differentiation:

Sum and Difference : (u(x) ± v(x))’=u'(x)±v'(x)
Product rule: (u(x) × v(x))’=u′(x)×v(x)+u(x)×v′(x)
Quotient Rule : 
 
 
 
Chain Rule: dy(u(x))/dx = dy/du × du/dx

5. Differentiate sin(3x+5)

Solution: Say, y = sin (3x+5)

dy/dx = d[sin(3x+5)]/dx

= cos (3x+5) d(3x+5)/dx [ By chain rule]

= cos (3x+5) [3]

y’ = 3 cos (3x+5)

d[sin(3x+5)]/dx = 3 cos (3x+5)

6. Differentiate tan2x.

Solution: Say, y = tan2x

dy/dx = d(tan2x)/dx

= 2tan2-1x. d(tan x)/dx

= 2tan x sec2x

d[tan2x]/dx = 2tan x sec2x

7. Compute the derivative of f(x) = sin2x.

Solution: f(x) = sin2x = sin x sin x

= d(sin x)/dx. sin x + sin x.d(sin x)/dx

= cos x. sin x + sin x cos x

= 2 sin x cos x
