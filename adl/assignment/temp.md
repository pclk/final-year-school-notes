For Part 1, you will have to find a suitable computer vision dataset to train a deep learning model. You will (i) build and train your own deep learning model (ii) train another deep learning model (of your choice) using transfer learning. You are also expected to compare and comment on the performance of both models.

Part 1: Computer vision - Training from scratch vs Transfer learning.
### Selecting dataset
https://universe.roboflow.com/hung-5yuey/face-emotion-8vfzj
This is a face emotion computer vision dataset.
The reason why I chose this dataset is because it presents an excellent balance of complexity and accessibility for demonstrating both training a deep learning model from scratch and applying transfer learning techniques.  

Face emotion recognition is a computer vision task that requires capturing subtle facial expressions, making it complex enough to showcase the benefits of transfer learning from pre-trained models which have already learned generalizable image features.  

At the same time, face emotion datasets are readily available and often reasonably sized, allowing for training from scratch within the constraints of a typical assignment without requiring excessive computational resources or training time.  

Furthermore, the task itself is intuitively understandable and relatable, making it easier to interpret the performance differences between models trained using different approaches and to appreciate the practical implications of transfer learning in computer vision.

For Part 2, you will use the drug review data to build a text classifier. The dataset for
Part 2 is obtained from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedabdelwahabali/drugreview. Do remember to cite this reference in your report. A training and test dataset is provided. The outcome variable for this dataset is a rating from 1 to 10. You will have to convert this to a qualitative label (positive, negative) and train and tune your own deep learning model with the training dataset. Additionally, you should look for another sentiment dataset and use this dataset to train and tune a second deep learning model with the same architecture/layers as the first model. You are expected to comment on the performance of both models on test data from the drug review dataset.
