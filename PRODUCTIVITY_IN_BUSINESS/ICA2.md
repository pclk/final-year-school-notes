2. Project Background and Introduction
>Providing the unique rationale on your selection of the food court and its location.

I chose Koufu because analyzing Koufu provides insights into the productivity of a typical, widely accessible food court experience for the average Singaporean, especially since it often positions itself as a heartland, community-focused food court. 

I choose the Koufu outlet at NYP, because I eat there quite often, and thus, I have personal experience with it.

One contrast is Food Republic, with a potentially more "premium" or tourist-focused experience.

Koufu is also often located in high-traffic arrears like transport hubs, hospitals, or large residential areas, where operational efficiency to handle large volumes of customers is important, especially during peak hours. As seen in Figure 1, Koufu is often crowded with large amounts of customers.

**a. Who are the different groups of users in the food court?**
The different groups of users in the food court are:

Office workers, especially during lunch hours in CBD or office part locations. They come to koufu for quick, affordable yet nutritional meals during their break.

Residents, in heartland areas where you'd see families, and the elderly. They may come to koufu almost everyday during lunch and dinner. 

Since we're talking about NYP's koufu many students will also come. They come to koufu because it's affordable. This applies to students outside of NYP as well. Nearby JC students may come to NYP's koufu to eat.

If near or inside hospitals, you can see their staff, patients and their families and visitors.


**b & c. What and where are the customers' pain points, and what are the bottlenecks?**

The customers' pain points could be the long queues at the most popular stalls, especially during peak hours. In fact, this is one of the most major pain point and a bottle neck at almost any food court.

The customers also can find it difficult to find available tables, especially for larger groups which prefer to sit together. This can be a major bottleneck as well.

In some locations, the eaten dishes on the table might take a long time to clear, and customers might have to sit with it despite it being dirty and unpleasant.

Usually, there will be long queues in drink stalls, since there is only one drink stall per location. However, the queue might move faster since it generally takes less time to make a drink rather than a dish.

**d. What are the processes that make customers wait?**
Going step by step, we could start with the order taking process. If staff is not efficient enough,  it could take a long time before the customer can even order. 

Slow payment systems or cash-only, contribute to waiting for the next customer to finish ordering as well. Fortunately, all the stores at this location have quick payment systems like PayNow and credit card.

Then, the order preparation process is the time it takes for stalls to prepare the food after the order is placed. If the disk takes a long time to make, like western food, this can be significantly longer than say, a dish like economical mixed rice.

Part of the wait that comes with searching a seat is the Table Clearing process, which is the time it takes for the cleaning staff to clear and clean tables. However, NYP's Koufu has self-clearing policies, allowing for tables to be free of dishes quickly. It does take time for the cleaners to wipe the table clean however, and this can be unpleasant especially if the previous group ate oily foods like hotplate or mala.

Other than dish orders, the customer might first look and secure a seat. This can take time if customers have to wait for the seats to become available.


3. Productivity Analysis
>Providing good practices, productivity tools that have been implemented, bottlenecks,
wastages, etc. that result in the unproductive work processes.

>Use the 7 Waste and 5S productivity tools to analyse (but not limited to) the following
situations:
a. Identify the types of wastes that occur at the food court.
b. Identify the good practices with respect to the Two (2) productivity tools.

TIMWOOD is an acronym for the seven types of waste in manufacturing.
Transport, represents the movement of food ingredients, stall staff moving back and forth to retrieve the ingredients, cups, plates etc, as well as cleaners pushing a tray of dishes to the washing area.

Inventory, represents the overstocked ingredients that may spoil, too many trays and utensils taking up space.

Motion, represents the staff moving between stations to prepare orders, customers circling around looking for available seats, and cleaners making multiple trips to clear the large amount of utensils at the self-return area.

Waiting, represents the students queuing during peak lunch hours, waiting for food preparation, waiting for food preparation, waiting for tables to be cleaned.

Overproduction, represents preparing too much dish or drinks, cooking large batches of food that may not sell.

Over-processing, represents redundant processes like repeatedly checking the customer's orders.

Defects, represent wrong orders, food quality issues that requires the remaking of the dish. Also includes customers finding out that the utensils are dirty and need to change them.

The 5S tool comes from the five japanese words, Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke.

Sort (Seiri), means clear separation of cooking equipment from different stalls, as well as organized storage of cleaning supplies. Some recommendation includes removing unnecessary items from counter spaces, and clearing expired products more regularly.

Set in Order (Seiton), means clearly marking the queue lines, and organizing the condiment stations. Some recommendation includes better seating layout arrangement, and more efficient organization of order preparation areas.

Shine (Seiso), means regular cleaning schedules and a self-return tray system. Some recommendation includes wiping tables more frequently during peak hours, and better cleaning of floors, since food can drop there.

Standardize (Seiketsu), means having Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for food preparation, and having consistent pricing displays. Some recommendation includes standardizing cleaning procedures, and creating visual guides for processes, like a cleaning route label on the floor. 

Sustain (Shitsuke), means having regular staff training and a consistent enforcement of hygiene standards. Some recommendation includes a monitoring and reporting system of the 5S implementation, and a customer feedback system for improvement.


4. Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the 7 Wastes and 5S analysis of NYP Koufu, key areas for improvement revolve around reducing customer waiting times, optimizing table turnover, and minimizing motion waste for both staff and customers. To address these, I propose the following two creative solutions:

Recommendation 1: Mobile Ordering and Smart Table System

Process Improvement: Implement a mobile ordering system integrated with a smart table management system. Customers can use a mobile app or website accessed via QR codes on the table to browse menus, place orders, and pay in advance before arriving at the food court or while finding and seating at table. This system exists in North Canteen.

Waste Reduction & Customer Delight:

*   **Reduces Waiting (Waiting Waste):** Customers bypass queues at stalls, especially during peak hours. Order placement is faster and more convenient. This will result in less crowding at the stalls, and allow easy collection of orders without people blocking the way.
*   **Optimizes Seating (Motion Waste & Customer Delight):** Integrate the mobile app with a table occupancy sensor system. The app can show real-time table availability, guiding customers to empty tables quickly, reducing aimless wandering (Motion waste) and frustration.  Potentially, the app could even allow for table reservations during peak hours.
*   **Improves Order Accuracy (Defect Reduction):** Digital orders reduce errors in order taking compared to verbal communication, minimizing wrong orders and remakes (Defect waste).
*   **Enhances Customer Experience (Customer Delight):** Offers a modern, convenient, and efficient experience, especially appealing to the tech-savvy student population at NYP.

Recommendation 2: Centralized Dish Return and Automated Sorting System

Process Improvement: Establish centralized dish return stations equipped with an automated sorting system. Instead of multiple dish return points, create one or two easily accessible central stations.

Waste Reduction & Customer Delight:

*   **Reduces Motion & Transport (Motion & Transport Waste):**  Customers only need to bring trays to a central point. Cleaning staff motion is reduced as they collect from fewer, concentrated locations.  Automated sorting (e.g., using a conveyor belt and sensors to separate different types of dishes, cutlery, and waste) at these stations further reduces manual handling and speeds up the dishwashing process.
*   **Faster Table Turnover (Waiting Waste & Customer Delight):**  Efficient dish return and sorting leads to quicker table clearing, making tables available for new customers sooner, reducing waiting times for seating.
*   **Improves Hygiene and Convenience (Customer Delight):** Faster removal of used dishes from tables improves the overall cleanliness and dining environment, addressing customer concerns about table hygiene. Having just 1 or two clearly marked central station also allows reduced confusion and wasted time searching. Automated sorting allows for the return areas to be free from crowded dirty dishes.
*   **Optimizes Cleaning Staff Productivity:** Allows cleaning staff to focus more on wiping tables and maintaining overall cleanliness rather than spending excessive time collecting and sorting dishes.


In conclusion, this analysis of Koufu at NYP, through the lens of the 7 Wastes and 5S methodologies, reveals significant opportunities to enhance productivity and customer satisfaction.  The key areas for improvement identified are reducing customer waiting times, optimizing table turnover, and minimizing motion waste. To address these, this report proposes two creative solutions: a Mobile Ordering and Smart Table System, and a Centralized Dish Return and Automated Sorting System.  Implementing these recommendations would streamline processes, reduce various forms of waste, and ultimately create a more efficient and pleasant dining experience for Koufu's customers, particularly in high-traffic locations like NYP.
