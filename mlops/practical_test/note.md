# deck: mlops revision

A -high variance- model sees patterns in noise and seeks to predict every single variation, resulting in a complex model that does not generalise well beyond its training data. 

In a decision tree algorithm,  data continues to be split in two according to what looks to be the best predictor in the subset that reached this path, the depth of the tree is considered a -hyperparameter- to configure the algorithm.

What is NOT a component needed for building a Machine Learning model?
Log

Deep Learning models can be used to transform images and text into tables of numbers that are usable by Machine Learning algorithms. These tables are called -embeddings-.

We can deploy our Machine Learning models as microservices using AWS Lambda?
True

DevOps is a set of business and management practices that aims to release software to production soonest?
False

Monitoring and instrumentation are the processes and techniques used that allow an organization to make decisions about a software system's availability?
False

Machine learning model performance is often very sensitive to the production environment it is running in, including the versions of software and operating systems in use?
True

What is NOT a tool used for versioning our code?
V7

A predictive maintenance system that alerts network engineers on possible problems before network failures happen is a use case of -AIOps-.

Adding more features in modelling may impact MLOps strategy as it requires more inputs and more maintenance down the line?
True

The tendency for overfitting is one of the challenges in using a decision tree algorithm?
False

What are the 2 key metrics for risk assessments?
Probability and Impact of the adverse event. 

What is not the 2 key metrics for risk assessments?
Frequency of the occurrence of the adverse event, and number of affected services.

-Continuous Integration- is the process of continuously testing a software project and improving the quality based on these tests' results.

What are the tools that can be used as Big Data platforms?
Databricks, Hadoop/Spark, and Google Big Query.

What is not a tool that can be used as Big Data platforms?
Amazon Sage Maker.

All Machine Learning models should be monitored after deployment to detect deviation and production bias?
True

In MLOps, we just need to focus on data versioning to ensure reproducibility and facilitate auditing?
False

DevOps is a set of business and management practices that aims to release software to production soonest?
False

Machine learning model performance is often very sensitive to the production environment it is running in, including the versions of software and operating systems in use?
True
