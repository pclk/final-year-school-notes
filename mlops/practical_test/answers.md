Depending on the impact of the model's predictions, decisions, or classifications, a more or less deep understanding may be required. Briefly describe TWO (2) reasonable steps data scientists should take to ensure the model is not actively harmful.
data understanding/data engineering need to analyse the avaiable data and see what other data need to be collected and deploy model you need to ensure that the model using is suitable and save to use and help the company to apply the module. data scientist also need to determine when to retrain the model and add additional changes if necessary.
