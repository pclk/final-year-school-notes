# We do Market Segmentation because it better defines {{customer needs}} and {{objectives}}, as well as {{allocating resources efficiently}}.

# We can segment by {{Geographic}}, {{Demographic}}, {{Psychographic}} and {{Behavioural}} Segmentation.

# {{Geographic}} segmentation is dependent on {{nations}}, {{regions}}, {{countries}}, and {{neighbourhoods}}.

# {{Demographic}} segmentation is dependent on {{age}}, {{gender}}, {{income}}, {{occupation}}, {{education}}, {{religion}} and {{ethnicity}}.

# {{Pyschographic}} segmentation is dependent on {{lifestyle}}, {{beliefs}}, {{social class}}, {{values}}, and {{personality}}.

# {{Behavioural}} segmentation is dependent on {{usage frequency}}, {{brand loyalty}}, {{benefits}}, and {{occasion}}.

# The criteria of effective segmentation is to be {{accessible}}, {{measurable}}, {{substantial}}, {{differentiable}} and {{actionable}}.

# {{Accessible}} segmentation means that segment can be {{engaged}} and {{served}} easily

# {{Measurable}} segmentation means that {{number of customers}}, {{purchasing power}}, and other customers insights should be available.

# {{Substantial}} segmentation means that segment is {{large}} or {{profitable}} enough to serve.

# {{Differentiable}} segmentation means that segment is {{clearly defined}}, so that {{marketing tools}} can be applied to them.

# {{Actionable}} segmentation means that segment has {{proven data}} for a {{sales approach}}.

# {{Digital analytics}} is fantastic for {{market segmentation}}.

# The second step of {{market segmentation}} is {{targeted marketing}}.

# {{Target marketing}} is the evaluation of each segment's {{attractiveness}} and selection of one or more to enter.

# When evaluating each segment, the factors to consider are the segment {{size}} and {{growth}}, segment {{structural attractiveness}}, and the companies {{objectives}} and {{resources}}.

# {{Undifferentiated}} marketing, also called {{mass}} marketing, focuses on the {{common}} needs of the consumers, and targets the {{whole}} market.

# {{Differentiated}} marketing focuses on higher {{sales}} and a stronger {{position}} with each market segment, targets {{several}} markets. This however, increases the costs.

# {{Concentrated}} marketing focuses on acquiring a {{large}} share in {{1}} market segment. This results in {{strong}} market position, and requires {{less}} resources. However, there is some {{risks}} in focusing in 1 market segment.

# {{Micro}}-marketing focuses on tailoring {{products}} and {{marketing}} programs to very small market segments.
