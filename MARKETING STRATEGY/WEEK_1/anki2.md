# The 5 concepts which an organization can adopt to design and carry out their marketing strategy is: {{production concept}}, {{product concept}}, {{selling concept}}, {{marketing concept}} and {{societal marketing concept}}

# In the inside-out approach, companies do {{no customer research}}.

# In the outside-in approach, companies do {{customer research}}.

# The reason why companies adopted the {{inside-out}} approach in the period of 1920 to 1950, is because {{there was not much competition}}.

# In the production concept, companies focus on improving {{production}} and {{distribution}} efficiency and making products {{cheap}}.

# The situations which encourage production concept are when {{demand exceeds supply}}, and {{management wants to increase production}} and {{high cost of product}}.

# In the product concept, companies focus on making {{continuous product improvements}} from {{the company's perspective}}.

# In the product concept, companies make the assumption that customers only care about {{quality}}, {{performance}} and {{innovative features}}.

# In the selling concept, companies make the assumption that consumers will only buy if they're {{hard sold}} and {{receive discounts and gifts}}.

# In the selling concept, companies focus on {{creating sales transactions}} rather than {{building relationship}}.

# The reason why companies adopted the {{outside-in}} approach after 1950, is because {{there was more competition}}.

# In the Marketing concept, companies focus on {{knowing the needs and wants}} of {{target markets}}.

# In the Societal concept, companies consider the {{society's long run interests}} in addition to other objectives.

# In today's context, with the inside-out and outside-in, companies are choosing to adopt {{both}}.

# {{Customer relationship management}} is the overall process of {{building and maintaining profitable customer relationship}} by delivering superior {{customer value}} and {{satisfaction}}.

# {{Customer lifetime value (CLV)}} is the value of the {{entire stream of purchases}} a customer makes over {{a lifetime of patronage}}.

# {{Customer Equity (CE)}} is the {{total customer lifetime values}} of all the company's {{current & potential customer}}.

# The 3 approaches to Profitable & Loyal Customers are {{Financial benefit}}, {{Social benefit}} and {{Structural benefit}}.

# {{Financial Benefits}} means to {{reward customers}} for {{patronage and loyalty}}.

# {{Social Benefits}} means to {{engage customers}} with {{events and community building}}.

# {{Structural Benefits}} means to {{link customers}} with {{the firm}} through {{technologies}} or {{supply chain technologies}}.
