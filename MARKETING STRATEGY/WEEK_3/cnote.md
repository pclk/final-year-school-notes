The Buyer Decision Process
1. Need Recognition
   - The buyer becomes aware of the problem or need
   - Marketers use various methods to trigger recognition of needs
2. Information Search
   - The consumer searches for information to resolve the problem or satisfy the need
   - Involves various sources of information
   - Sources 
    - Personal: family, friends, neighbor
    - Commercial: ads, salespeople
    - Public: mass-media, consumer-rating groups
    - Experimental: handle, examining, using product.
3. Evaluation of Alternatives
   - Consumers evaluate different brands/products based on important attributes
   - Decisions can be made through careful calculations, logic, impulse, or reliance on others
4. Purchase Decision
   - Factors that influence the final purchase decision include attitudes of others and unexpected situational factors
5. Post-Purchase Behavior
   - Consumer satisfaction is a function of their expectations and the perceived performance of the product
     - If performance < expectations, the consumer is disappointed
     - If performance = expectations, the consumer is satisfied 
     - If performance > expectations, the consumer is delighted
   - Cognitive Dissonance
     - Refers to the buyer's discomfort or conflict caused by post-purchase doubt about whether the decision was right
     - Arises from a conflict between the action of buying and the opinion that the purchase decision may have been wrong
     - Consumers take action to reduce or eliminate this cognitive dissonance

What Marketers Can Do to Lessen Cognitive Dissonance:
1. Affirm the customer's decision by:
   - Thanking customers for buying their products
   - Showing that famous celebrities/influencers are still using and endorsing the product
2. Set up systems that encourage customer feedback about the products and services (e.g. phone, email)
3. Allow refunds, exchanges, or provide vouchers for the next purchase

Online Consumer Behavior
- The "always-connected" consumer expects:
  - To be recognized and treated as an individual
  - Personalized, relevant content and offers
  - A seamless brand experience across channels 
  - The ability to share their thoughts and voice
  - Convenience and helpful, informative experiences at every stage

Shifts in the Customer Journey in a Connected World:
1. In the pre-connectivity era, the individual customer determined their own attitude towards a brand. In the connectivity era, the initial brand appeal is influenced by the "community".
2. In the pre-connectivity era, loyalty was often defined as retention and repurchase. In the connectivity era, loyalty is ultimately defined as willingness to advocate for the brand.
3. Customers are now actively connected with one another, building "ask-and-advocate" relationships. Depending on the bias during these conversations, the connection can either strengthen or weaken the brand appeal.

Rate of Adoption / Diffusion Process
- In today's competitive world, the speed at which a consumer adopts (or buys) a new product is known as the "Rate of Adoption" or "Diffusion Process"
- Factors that influence the rate of adoption:
  - Relative Advantage: The extent to which the new innovation is superior to existing products
  - Compatibility: How well the new product fits the values and experiences of potential users
  - Complexity: How difficult the new product is to understand or use
  - Divisibility: The extent to which the innovation can be used/tried on a limited basis
