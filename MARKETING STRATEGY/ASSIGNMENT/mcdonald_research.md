Initial Plant-Based Ventures:
 In 2019, McDonald's first tested the P.L.T. (Plant, Lettuce, Tomato) burger in partnership with Beyond Meat in Canada
This marked their first serious venture into plant-based alternatives
The test was relatively limited and eventually discontinued

 McPlant Development:
 In 2020, McDonald's announced the McPlant platform
This was developed as part of their broader strategy to offer plant-based options
The primary focus was initially on burgers rather than nuggets
The McPlant burger was co-developed with Beyond Meat

Competitive Landscape:
 Burger King had already launched plant-based nuggets in some markets
KFC had successful trials with Beyond Fried Chicken
Other fast-food chains were also exploring plant-based options
 Consumer Trends:
 Growing demand for plant-based alternatives
Increased focus on sustainability
Rising vegetarian and flexitarian populations
