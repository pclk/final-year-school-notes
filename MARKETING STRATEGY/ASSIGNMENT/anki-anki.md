Intro

Hello Dr. Veronica, I'm joined by Jet, Ethan and Dekai, to present McNugg-ain't, the plant-based alternative to the traditional chicken nugget.

Slide 2

## Back
Looking at the environmental context, we're seeing notable increases and the significance of meat production, like manure and agriculture soil management.

Slide 3

## Back
These concerns become even more striking when we look at resource efficiency. A plant-based diet requires just 450 kg of feed grains compared to 816 kg for meat-based diets, directly translating to less land use, water consumption and environmental impact.

CAGR

## Back
And what's particularly compelling is how this environmental efficiency aligns with McDonald's growth opportunities. Looking at our slide, the plant-based food market is projected to experience a growth of 11.2% CAGR from 2023 to 2031.

Meat substitute consumers

## Back
This market potential is supported with research into Singaporean meat substitute consumers, where 48% demand that their food be convenient and fast, exactly what McNugg-ain't delivers through our large distributed franchises.

Background - Social media engagements

## Back
The social media engagements are also promising. Our target market shows significantly higher engagement rates across all metrics.

Example of plant-based options

## Back
As we've seen the opportunity in this growing market, McDonald's has been actively exploring plant-based options. An example is the
McPlant, which saw success in the UK and Ireland with 1400 restaurants, but its performance in the US was limited. From which we learnt that there was strong competition from fast-food chains offering plant-based burgers, and the high price-point of substitute meat.

Transition to SWOT

## Back
This brings us to our plant-based nuggets, the McNugg-ain't. Instead of competing in the saturated plant-based burger market, we're targeting the nugget segment with a product that's cost-effective, family-friendly, and convenient. To evaluate this opportunity, let's examine our position with a SWOT analysis.

SWOT - Strengths and weaknesses

## Back
Looking at our key competitors,

Subway has positioned itself with low-cost operations and a healthy image, offering vegan options through their customizable menu format, but constrained by limited protein alternatives and lower brand perception.

Burger King, while first to market with their plant-based Whopper, remains limited by single-supplier dependency.

SWOT - Opportunities 1

## Back
This creates three key opportunities:

First, the plant-based nugget segment remains largely untapped. While burger searches dominate at 72.9%, nugget searches sit at 27.1%, a clear opportunity for McNugg-ain't leadership.

Second, our network of 153 franchises, versus Burger King's 131 and Subway's 67, positions us perfectly for the convenience-seeking market.

SWOT - Opportunities 3

## Back
Third, with 257 thousand Instagram followers, more than five times of Burger King and over 23 times of Subway, we can amplify the McNugg-ain't launch and reach a larger audience at a lower marketing cost.

However, we must address three critical threats.

# Note

## Front
SWOT - Threats 1

## Back
First, customer expectations.
As a well-established brand, if we fail to meet expectations in taste, texture, or healthiness, we risk low adoption rates and potential brand damage. However, we can mitigate these risks through taste tests and strategic marketing campaigns.

SWOT - Threats 2

## Back
Second, competitive differentiation.
With the growing plant-based market, If McDonald's fails to differentiate McNugg-ain't from its competitors, we risk losing market share and sales potential. We'll mitigate this through our unique value proposition, which is convenience, leveraging our brand equity, and thorough market research.

SWOT - Threats 3

## Back
Third, Sustainability claims.
If our claims aren't properly substantiated, we risk accusations of greenwashing and potential regulatory backlash. Our mitigation strategy includes third-party audits of our supply chain and transparent communication of our environmental impact data.

With this positioning and comprehensive risk mitigation approach, let's now take a look into our marketing objectives and target market segment by Jet.
