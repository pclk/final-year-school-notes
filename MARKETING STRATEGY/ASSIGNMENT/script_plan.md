# Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is weiheng, ... and we will be presenting our product: the Mc Nugg-ain't by Mcdonalds.

# Background
## Why plant based?
From 1998 to 2018, the world's population increased dramatically, where meat consumption increased by 58%. The consequence is a strain on the environment, mainly the production of GreenHouse Gases (GHG). Agriculture and food systems contribute more than 24%, of which meat and diary contribute significantly. In contrast, comsumption plant-based diets can decrease GHG emissions.

Given the concern for environment sustainability, consumers are changing their diet patterns to include more plant-based sources.

## Why Singapore consumers?
The recent collection on Singapore Consumer Data on Meat Substitute consumers shows the following traits, which are beneficial to Mcdonald's brand and our business goals. We are going to focus Meat vs Non-meat substitute consumers.

48% of them believe that Food must be convenient and fast, as opposed to 38% of the total respondents. Our superior distribution network of 153 chains all over Singapore, and high operational efficiency is sure to meet and attract many of these consumers.

They also interact with companies more on social media than the average onliner, bringing opportunities to boost social media metrics and bring more online attention to the McDonald's brand if we were to capture these consumers.

They live in nuclear families, where our McNugg-ain't can serve as a great introduction to their children's plant-based diets, as well as a healthier and sustainable food option for children.

# SWOT
## Subway vs Burger King. 
We identify 2 well-established fast food restaurant with plant-based offerings as our competitors. We will place Subway and Pizza Hut as our competitors

## Strengths
The strength of Subway is lower prices. This is because of their lower operational complexity, minimal staff training required due to their sandwich main dish, which is quick and easy to prepare. They are also branded with freshness, health and sustainability.

The strength of Burger King is their Proprietary Plant-based whoppers technology. This technology allows them to position themselves with a premium product. They are branded with premium and innovation.

## Weakness
The Weakness of Subway is the weak brand. It is seen as a cheap brand, and there is not much excitement or innovation associated with Subway.

The Weakness of Burger King is the high price point.

## Opportunities
Our target audience for McNugg-ain't would be meat substitute consumers. These are defined with middle-high class gen Z and millennial vegetarians, 

## Threats

# Intro
1. Hello Dr. Veronica, I'm joined by Jet, Ethan and Dekai, to present McNugg-ain't, the plant-based alternative to the traditional chicken nugget.

2. Looking at the environmental context, we're seeing notable increases and the significance of meat production, like manure and agriculture soil management.

3. These concerns become even more striking when we look at resource efficiency. A plant-based diet requires just 450 kg of feed grains compared to 816 kg for meat-based diets, directly translating to less land use, water consumption and environmental impact.

4. And what's particularly compelling is how this environmental efficiency aligns with McDonald's growth opportunities. Looking at our slide, the plant-based food market is projected to experience a growth of 11.2% CAGR from 2023 to 2031. 

5. This market potential is supported with research into Singaporean meat substitute consumers, where 48% demand that their food be convenient and fast, exactly what McNugg-ain't delivers through our large distributed franchises.

6. The social media engagements are also promising. Our target market shows significantly higher engagement rates across all metrics. 

7. As we've seen the opportunity in this growing market, McDonald's has been actively exploring plant-based options. An example is the
McPlant, which saw success in the UK and Ireland with 1400 restaurants, but its performance in the US was limited. From which we learnt that there was strong competition from fast-food chains offering plant-based burgers, and the high price-point of substitute meat.

11. This brings us to our plant-based nuggets, the McNugg-ain't. Instead of competing in the saturated plant-based burger market, we're targeting the nugget segment with a product that's cost-effective, family-friendly, and convenient. To evaluate this opportunity, let's examine our position with a SWOT analysis.

# SWOT analysis

12. Looking at our key competitors,

Subway has positioned itself with low-cost operations and a healthy image, offering vegan options through their customizable menu format, but constrained by limited protein alternatives and lower brand perception.

Burger King, while first to market with their plant-based Whopper, remains limited by single-supplier dependency.

13. This creates three key opportunities:

First, the plant-based nugget segment remains largely untapped. While burger searches dominate at 72.9%, nugget searches sit at 27.1%, a clear opportunity for McNugg-ain't leadership.

14. Second, our network of 153 franchises, versus Burger King's 131 and Subway's 67, positions us perfectly for the convenience-seeking market.

15. Third, with 257 thousand Instagram followers, more than five times of Burger King and over 23 times of Subway, we can amplify the McNugg-ain't launch and reach a larger audience at a lower marketing cost.

However, we must address three critical threats.
 
16. First, customer expectations.
As a well-established brand, if we fail to meet expectations in taste, texture, or healthiness, we risk low adoption rates and potential brand damage. However, we can mitigate these risks through taste tests and strategic marketing campaigns. 

17. Second, competitive differentiation.
With the growing plant-based market, If McDonald's fails to differentiate McNugg-ain't from its competitors, we risk losing market share and sales potential. We'll mitigate this through our unique value proposition, which is convenience, leveraging our brand equity, and thorough market research.

18. Third, Sustainability claims.
If our claims aren't properly substantiated, we risk accusations of greenwashing and potential regulatory backlash. Our mitigation strategy includes third-party audits of our supply chain and transparent communication of our environmental impact data.

19. With this positioning and comprehensive risk mitigation approach, let's now take a look into our marketing objectives and target market segment by Jet.
