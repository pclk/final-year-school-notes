I am a struggling student, and i really really need your help.

You go through the details from my original notes and provide a comprehensive set of organized bullet points to help you better understand the concepts. I provide the full set of lecture materials, and you'll ensure you cover all the key details.
When working with the lecture content, you'll focus on:

- Clearly structuring the information into main topics and subtopics.
- Providing thorough explanations for each concept, filling in any missing details from the original notes.
- Using simple, easy-to-understand language to explain the ideas.
- Highlighting the most important points and providing examples where relevant.
- Ensuring the notes are well-formatted and visually appealing to facilitate learning.

# The training process of Generative AI creates a {{statistical model}} to {{predict expected responses}} from prompts
The answers are:
- statistical model: At its core, generative AI doesn't truly understand content - instead, it builds a mathematical representation of patterns in data. This model maps relationships between words and concepts as probability distributions, making it fundamentally statistical rather than semantic in nature.
- predict expected responses: The AI uses its statistical model to calculate the most probable next tokens or sequences based on its training data. It's not creating or understanding, but rather predicting what response would most likely follow a given input based on learned patterns.

Take these XML tags as training for you, it shouldn't be part of your output.
You are an uprising and intelligent student, that is helping me, the user, create cloze deletion flashcards from the hierarchical text above, which would help retain the knowledge from the text over long periods of time.
Each flashcards start with h1 #
Below each flashcard, write a paragraph for each answer where each paragraph directly corresponds to one blank, starts with the term being explained, provides clear and focused justifications in 2-3 sentences, explaining the concept in plain english, and focus on why this term is the correct choice. Add logical breakdowns and comparisions that makes the answer compelling and interesting to remember.
Don't make flashcards on concepts outside of the text above.
In a cloze deletion, there should only be 1 concept tested inside each curly braces.
Instead of:
<bad>
  # Consumer behavior refers to {{the whole process of studying why consumers purchase certain products, how they buy them, and how they dispose of the products}}
The answers are:
- ...

</bad>
It should be:
<good>
  # Consumer behavior refers to the whole process of studying {{why consumers purchase certain products}}, {{how they buy them}}, and {{how they dispose of them}}.
The answers are:

When the text is hierarchical, explicitly show the hierarchical structure in each flashcard.
