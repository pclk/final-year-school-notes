# 1. Fundamentals of Ensemble Learning

## What is an Ensemble Model?
- A group of such models & predictors is called an ensemble, while the individual predictors of the ensemble are called base predictors.
- Goal: Improve prediction accuracy by leveraging strengths of multiple models

## Why Use Ensemble Methods?
- Improved accuracy compared to single models
- Better generalizability and robustness
- Proven track record in:
  - Winning machine learning competitions (Kaggle, Netflix)
  - Real-world applications (e.g., Microsoft Kinect using Random Forests)

# 2. Key Conditions for Ensemble Success

## Two Essential Requirements:
1. Base Classifier Performance
   - Must perform better than random guessing
   - Should have reasonable individual accuracy

2. Independence of Classifiers
   - Base classifiers should be independent
   - Errors should be uncorrelated

3. Bias and Variance 
   - Reduce bias and variance by aggregation effect
   - Overall, comparable bias but smaller variance.

# 3. Main Types of Ensemble Methods

## A. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
1. Characteristics
   - Parallel ensemble method
   - Base predictors trained independently
   - Better scalability
   - After training, predictions are also done in parallel.

2. Process
   - Creates multiple data subsets through bootstrap sampling
   - Trains same model type on different data subsets
   - Combines predictions through voting (classifiers) or averaging (regressors)

3. Bootstrap Sampling
   - Random sampling with replacement.
   - Meaning sample size stays same and duplicate sampling is ok.
   - Each sample has equal probability of selection

4. Aggregating for Classifiers
   - Hard voting
      - Each classifier gets 1 vote, classifier with most votes wins.
   - Soft voting 
      - Average the probability scores from each classifier
      - Usually higher accuracy

## B. Random Forest
1. Special Case of Bagging
   - Uses decision trees as base predictors
   - Adds extra randomness in feature selection
   - Each tree uses random subset of features

2. Advantages
   - Better handles overfitting
   - Trades higher bias for lower variance
   - Often achieves better overall prediction

# Boosting
1. Key Difference from Bagging
   - Sequential building of models
   - Gradually adjusts parameter weights
   - Focuses on reducing bias

## LightGBM
  - By Microsoft
  - Only 1 leaf from the whole tree will be grown
  - This results in higher accuracy, but may lead to overfitting 
  - Benefits:
    - Faster training speed and higher efficiency
    - Lower memory usage
    - Better accuracy
    - Perform equally good in Large Dataset as XGBoost but with faster training speed

# 4. Practical Implementation

## Using Scikit-Learn
1. Bagging Classifier
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
bag_clf = BaggingClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    n_estimators=500,
    max_samples=100
)
```

2. Random Forest
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_leaf_nodes=16
)
```

## Key Parameters to Consider
- base_estimator: Type of model to use
- n_estimators: Number of models in ensemble
- max_samples: Sample size for each base estimator
- bootstrap: Whether to use replacement in sampling
- oob_score: Whether to use out-of-bag evaluation

# Boosting

## Basic Concept
- Sequential ensemble learning technique (unlike parallel Bagging)
- Builds models sequentially, each learning from previous model's errors
- Progressive improvement through error correction

## Process Flow
1. Initial Model Creation
   - Starts with base classifier on training data
2. Sequential Learning
   - Each new classifier focuses on previous model's mistakes
   - Continues until reaching:
     - Specified number of models
     - Desired accuracy level

# 2. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

## Core Characteristics
- Uses decision stumps (single-split decision trees) as base learners
- Implements adaptive instance weighting
- Iterative process (each iteration = boosting round)

## Working Process
1. Initial Setup
   - All training instances get equal weights (1/n)
   - Random subset selection based on weights

2. Weight Adjustment
   - Increases weights for incorrectly classified instances
   - Decreases weights for correctly classified instances
   - Makes subsequent models focus on difficult cases

3. Prediction
   - Combines predictions using weighted voting
   - Class with highest weighted votes wins

## Implementation in Scikit-Learn
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
ada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(
    DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1),
    n_estimators=200,
    random_state=42
)
```

# 3. Gradient Boosting

## Core Concept
- Sequential addition of predictors
- Focuses on residual errors from previous predictors
- Creates additive models stage by stage

## Working Process
1. Initial Model Building
   - Starts with simple base model
   - Analyzes prediction errors

2. Sequential Improvement
   - New models focus on hard-to-predict cases
   - Each model tries to correct residual errors
   - Combines predictions with weighted approach

## Key Hyperparameters
1. n_estimators (Number of boosting stages)
   - Usually larger numbers = better performance
   - Robust to overfitting

2. learning_rate
   - Controls step length (shrinkage)
   - Smaller values (e.g., 0.01)
     - Need more weak learners
     - Better generalization

## Implementation
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.01
)
```
