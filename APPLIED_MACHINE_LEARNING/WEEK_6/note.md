# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is used in games.

All actions is transformed to numbers. For example, agents that can move in 4 directions would have the directions translated to numbers.

What are the suitable actions to maximize reward? 

Reinforcement learning forces agents to learn from experience, instead of finding the relationship between to feature and label.

Parameters Reinforcement Learning Supervised Learning
Decision style reinforcement learning helps you to take your
decisions sequentially.
In this method, a decision is made on the
input given at the beginning.
Works on Works on interacting with the environment. Works on examples or given sample data.
Dependency on
decision
In RL method learning decision is dependent.
Therefore, you should give labels to all the
dependent decisions.
Supervised learning the decisions which are
independent of each other, so labels are given
for every decision.
Best suited Supports and work better in AI, where human
interaction is prevalent.
It is mostly operated with an interactive
software system or applications.
Example Chess game Object recognition

Reinforcement is about emulating a situation, and providing rewards when the desired response is provided. Thus, the cat will learn "what to do".


Characteristics of Reinforcement Learning
Here are important characteristics of reinforcement learning
• There is no supervisor, only a real number or reward signal
• Sequential decision making
• Time plays a crucial role in Reinforcement problems
• Feedback is always delayed, not instantaneous
• Agent's actions determine the subsequent data it receives


Learning Models of Reinforcement
There are two important concept in reinforcement learning model:
• Markov Decision Process
• Q learning


Markov Decision Process
The following parameters are used to get a solution:
• Set of actions- A
• Set of states -S
• Reward- R
• Policy- n
• Value- V
The mathematical approach for mapping a solution in reinforcement Learning is recon
as a Markov Decision Process or (MDP).

concepts regarding reward table is not tested.
