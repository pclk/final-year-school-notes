**Question:**

Which of the following statements BEST distinguishes Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Supervised Learning (SL) based on their core characteristics?

Reinforcement's decisions are impacted sequentially, whereas Supervised's decisions are based on the input at the start.

Reinforcement learns by interacting with the environment, whereas Supervised learns from the example labels of the features in a training dataset.

Reinforcement's decisions affect its future state, and subsequently the maximum cumulative reward it can obtain. This is called being having decisions that are dependent of each other. Supervised's decisions only take 1 step to complete, which is to input the features and output the prediction, with no affect to future predictions. This is having decisions that are independent of each other 



|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   |     |     | O   |
|     |     | O   |     |
|     | O   |     |     |
|     |     |     | R   |



**Actions:** Let's assume the agent can take four actions:
*   Up
*   Down
*   Left
*   Right

**1. Reward Table:**

The Reward table will define the immediate reward the agent receives when transitioning to a state. Let's set the rewards as follows:

*   Reaching the Reward state 'R' (state 15): +10
*   Moving into an Obstacle state 'O' (states 3, 6, 9): -10 (to discourage hitting obstacles)
*   Moving to any other empty state: 0

| State | Up   | Down | Left | Right |
| :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| **0**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | -10 (to 3) |
| **1**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **2**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **3**   | -10  | -10  | -10  | -10   | # Obstacle
| **4**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **5**   | 0    | 0    | -10 (to 6)| 0     |
| **6**   | -10  | -10  | -10  | -10   | # Obstacle
| **7**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **8**   | 0    | -10 (to 9)| 0    | 0     |
| **9**   | -10  | -10  | -10  | -10   | # Obstacle
| **10**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 10 (to 15)|
| **11**  | 0    | 10 (to 15)| 0    | 10 (to 15)|
| **12**  | 0    | N/A  | N/A  | 0     | # Bottom Row
| **13**  | 0    | N/A  | 0    | 0     | # Bottom Row
| **14**  | 0    | N/A  | 0    | 10 (to 15)| # Bottom Row
| **15**  | 0    | N/A  | 0    | N/A   | # Reward State (Terminal)

**Explanation of Reward Table:**

*   **Rows represent the current state.**
*   **Columns represent the action taken.**
*   **Values in the table are the immediate rewards** for taking that action from that state.
*   **"N/A"** indicates an invalid action (e.g., moving down from the bottom row).
*   **"-10 (to state X)"** indicates moving into an obstacle state 'O' (state X) results in a -10 reward.
*   **"10 (to state X)"** indicates moving into the reward state 'R' (state X) results in a +10 reward.

**2. Q-Table (Initialized to 0):**

The Q-table will store the Q-values for each state-action pair. Initially, we can initialize all Q-values to 0.  The Q-table will be updated as the agent learns.

| State | Up   | Down | Left | Right |
| :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| **0**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **1**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **2**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **3**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **4**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **5**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **6**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **7**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **8**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **9**   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **10**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **11**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **12**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **13**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **14**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     |
| **15**  | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0     | # Reward State

**Explanation of Q-Table:**

*   **Rows represent the current state.**
*   **Columns represent the action taken.**
*   **Values in the table (initially 0) will be the Q-values** representing the expected cumulative reward for taking that action in that state.
















































**Answer:**

c) RL is best suited for tasks with sequential decision-making and environmental interaction, learning to optimize actions based on rewards, while SL is effective for tasks like object recognition using labeled datasets.

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the key differences highlighted in the table:

*   **Decision Style:** RL is indeed designed for sequential decision-making in interactive environments, whereas SL makes decisions based on initial input and independent examples.
*   **Working Mechanism:** RL operates by interacting with an environment and learning from the rewards received, contrasting with SL which learns from provided examples or sample data.
*   **Best Suited Applications:** RL excels in scenarios like AI and interactive systems (e.g., games like Chess), while SL is well-suited for tasks like object recognition where labeled data is available.

The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental characteristics of RL and SL as described in the table. For example, option (a) reverses the decision dependency, option (b) swaps their learning mechanisms, and option (d) incorrectly describes RL's decision process and SL's learning approach.
