1. **Scenario:** A hospital wants to develop a system to diagnose patients' illnesses based on their symptoms and medical history. They have a dataset of patient records with diagnoses. To improve diagnostic accuracy, they train several different types of classifiers (like logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks) on the same dataset. When a new patient comes in, each classifier makes a diagnosis, and a final diagnosis is made by considering the predictions of all classifiers and using a logistic regression model to weigh their opinions.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario to improve illness diagnosis.

> This is the Stacking ensemble method. This is because the classifiers are different, and of the 3 methods, Boosting, Bagging and Stacking, only Stacking is heterogenous in their ensemble method.

2. **Scenario:** An online advertising company wants to optimize ad placement on websites to maximize click-through rates. They start with a simple strategy for placing ads randomly. Then, they iteratively refine their strategy. In each iteration, they observe which ad placements led to more clicks and adjust their strategy to favor those placements in the future, while still exploring new placements occasionally.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario to optimize ad placement.

> This is the Reinforcement learning method. The agent is the online advertising company, the reward is the number of clicks, and the agent is iteratively trying to find a policy in order to maximize their cumulative reward. The exploratory nature is also why it points towards the explore or exploit nature of reinforcement learning.

3. **Scenario:** A stock trading firm wants to predict stock price movements. They build hundreds of decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of historical stock market data and a random subset of technical indicators. To make a prediction for a stock, each tree independently predicts whether the stock price will go up or down. The final prediction is determined by taking the average prediction of all trees.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario to predict stock prices.

> This is bagging, more specifically, Random Forest. Random forest has decision trees as its base predictor, configured to have high bias and low variance, suitable for base predictors of an ensemble model.The bootstrapping process of training each base predictor on a random subset of the training data correlates with Random Forest's characteristics. The aggregation process also describes the averaging process of random forest regressor.

4. **Scenario:** A robotics company is developing a robot that learns to navigate a maze. The robot starts with no knowledge of the maze. It explores the maze, and for each action it takes (move forward, turn left, turn right), it receives a reward if it gets closer to the exit and a penalty if it hits a wall or moves further from the exit. The robot learns to choose actions that maximize its cumulative reward over time, eventually finding the optimal path to exit any maze.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario for robot maze navigation.

> This describes reinforcement learning. The agent is the robot, the environment is the maze, the action is the movement of the robot, the reward is the reward described in the scenario, and the penalty is hitting the wall or moving further from the exit. The robot is finding a policy in order to achieve its highest cumulative reward over time.

5. **Scenario:** A movie recommendation service wants to improve the accuracy of its recommendations. They start with a basic recommendation system. They then build a new model that tries to correct the errors made by the initial system. This new model focuses on users for whom the first system made incorrect recommendations. They repeat this process, building models sequentially, each trying to improve upon the errors of the previous models. The final recommendation is a combination of the predictions from all these models.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario to improve movie recommendations.

6. **Scenario:**  A fraud detection company wants to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. They create multiple logistic regression models. Each model is trained on a different random sample of credit card transaction data. When a new transaction occurs, each model predicts whether it is fraudulent or not. The final fraud prediction is made by taking the majority vote of all the logistic regression models.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario for fraud detection.

7. **Scenario:** A game playing AI is being developed for chess. The AI plays chess against itself or other opponents. After each game, it analyzes its moves and the outcome. If it wins, the AI reinforces the moves and strategies that led to victory. If it loses, it adjusts its strategies to avoid repeating the moves that led to defeat. Over many games, the AI learns to play chess at a high level.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario for game playing AI.

8. **Scenario:** An image classification system needs to identify different types of animals in images. To improve robustness and accuracy, they train several decision trees. To ensure diversity, each tree is trained on a random subset of the training images and, at each node split, considers only a random subset of features. The final classification is obtained by averaging the probability predictions of all trees.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario for image classification.

9. **Scenario:** A personalized learning platform wants to adapt the learning content to each student's needs. The platform starts by providing a standard curriculum. As the student interacts with the platform, answering questions and completing exercises, the platform observes the student's performance. Based on the student's successes and struggles, the platform dynamically adjusts the difficulty and content of the learning material to optimize the student's learning progress.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario for personalized learning.

10. **Scenario:** A natural language processing company wants to improve the sentiment analysis of customer reviews. They build a system that combines the predictions of three different classifiers: a Naive Bayes classifier, a Support Vector Machine, and a deep learning model. For each review, each classifier predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). A meta-classifier, such as another logistic regression model, is then trained to combine these predictions into a final sentiment score.

**Question:** Identify and explain the type of machine learning method being described in this scenario to improve sentiment analysis.
