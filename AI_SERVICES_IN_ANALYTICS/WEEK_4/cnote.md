# 1. Historical Foundations of AI üåü

## Alan Turing
* **Who was he?**
  * Known as the "father" of both computer science and AI

* **Major Contributions**
  * **Turing Machines**
    * Created mathematical machines that could solve complex problems
    * These became the foundation for modern computers
    * Showed how complex calculations could be broken down into simple steps
  
# 2. Understanding AI Testing Methods üîç

## A. The Original Turing Test
* **Basic Concept**
  * A human judge chats with both a human and a computer
  * If the judge can't tell which is which, the computer passes
  * First proposed in 1950
  * Still influences how we think about AI today

## B. ELIZA - The First Chatbot
* **Background**
  * Created in the 1960s at MIT
  * Named after a character who learned to speak properly in a play
  * Was revolutionary for its time

* **How it worked**
  * Acted like a therapist
  * Asked open-ended questions
  * Used simple pattern matching
  * Example:
    * User: "I am sad"
    * ELIZA: "Why do you feel sad?"

* **Important Points**
  * Didn't actually understand conversations
  * Just followed pre-programmed rules
  * Still influenced many modern chatbots

## C. The Chinese Room Argument
* **Basic Setup**
  * Imagine a room with:
    * A person who doesn't know Chinese
    * A book of rules in English to manipulate Chinese characters

* **The Argument**
  * The person can match symbols perfectly using rules
  * They still don't understand Chinese
  * Similarly, computers might:
    * Process language perfectly
    * But not truly understand it

* **This Led to Two Types of AI**
  * **Strong AI**
    * Goal: Create machines that truly understand
    * Like human consciousness
    * True intelligence
  
  * **Weak AI**
    * Goal: Create machines that work effectively
    * Don't need to truly understand
    * Focus on results, not consciousness

# 3. Modern AI Testing Methods üöÄ

## A. Winograd Schemas
* **Purpose**: Tests if AI really understands context
* **Example**:
  * "The trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it is too small"
  * Question: What is too small? (trophy or suitcase?)
  * AI needs to understand context to answer correctly

## B. Other Important Tests
* **The Coffee Test**
  * Created by Apple's co-founder
  * Task: Robot must:
    * Enter a regular house
    * Find the coffee maker
    * Make coffee

* **Goertzel Tests**
  * Reading comprehension tests
  * Elementary school curriculum
  * Preschool graduation requirements

* LAMBADA benchmark

# 4. Understanding Dialogflow üí¨

## A. What is Dialogflow?
* **Types of Chatbots**
  1. **Goal-Oriented**
     * Focus on specific tasks
  
  2. **Conversational**
     * General chat capability
     * More flexible responses
     * Like having a conversation

## B. Dialogflow Console
- Web user interface
  - Different from GCP console
  - Useful for most cases
  - Dialogflow API for advanced use cases.

## C. Dialogflow Editions
* **Trial Version**
  * Free to use
  * Good for learning
  * Limited features and support

* **Essentials (ES)**
  * Standard features

* **Customer Experience (CX)**
  * Advanced features

- Both ES and CX are
  - pay as you go 
  - production-ready quotas and support

# 5. Core Dialogflow Components üîß

## A. Agents (Virtual Assistants)
* **Definition**
  * Virtual agent handling multiple concurrent user conversations
  * Uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to process human language
  * Similar to training a human customer service agent

* Automatically updates machine learning model when you:
  * Make changes to intents
  * Modify entities
  * Import/restore agent settings
  * Manually train the agent
  
* **Management**
  * Managed through Dialogflow Console (for agent building)
  * Separate from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console
    * GCP Console: Handles billing and resources
    * Dialogflow Console: Manages agent behavior

## B. Intents (Conversation Understanding)

### 1. Basic Intent Structure
* **Training Phrases**
  * Minimum 10-20 examples needed
  * More phrases = better understanding
  * Machine learning expands on your examples
  * Examples:
    ```
    "What's the weather like?"
    "Tell me today's weather"
    "Is it going to rain?"
    ```

* **Actions**
  * Defines what happens when intent matches
  * Triggers specific functions in your system
  * Can be used to track conversation flows

* **Parameters**
  * Extracted values from user expressions
  * Each parameter has an entity type
  * Controls how data is extracted
  * Example:
    ```
    User: "Book a room for tomorrow"
    Parameter: @sys.date = "tomorrow"
    ```

* **Responses**
  * Static or dynamic text replies
  * Can include:
    * Text responses
    * Speech responses
    * Visual elements
    * Dynamic content using parameters

### 2. Complex Intent Features
* **Slot Filling**
  * Automatically collects required information
  * Continues asking until all needed data is gathered
  * Can have multiple prompts for variety:
    ```
    "What date?"
    "What date would you like?"
    "Which date works for you?"
    ```

* **Context Awareness**
  * Maintains conversation flow
  * Remembers previous interactions
  * Can reference earlier mentioned items

* **Events**
  * Triggers intents based on events, not just user input
  * Example: Default Welcome Intent triggers on conversation start

## C. Entities (Data Extraction)

### 1. System Entities (@sys)
* **Date and Time**
  * @sys.time
  * @sys.date
  * @sys.datetime

* **Numbers**
  * @sys.number

* **Contact Information**
  * @sys.email
  * @sys.phone-number

* **Geography**
  * @sys.address
  * @sys.airport

* **Names**
  * @sys.last-name

### 2. Developer Entities (Custom)
* **Creation Methods**
  * Through console interface
  * Via API
  * Bulk upload through CSV
  * Example:
    ```
    Entity: size
    Values: 
      - S (small, little)
      - M (medium, regular)
      - L (large, big)
    ```

* **Best Practices**
  * Only create entities needed for actionable data
  * Use synonyms for better matching
  * Regular updates based on user interactions

### 3. User/Session Entities
* **Characteristics**
  * Created through API
  * Temporary matching patterns

## D. Context Management

### 1. Input and Output Contexts
* **Output Contexts**
  * Set by matched intents
  * Become active after intent match
  * Controls what context is "remembered"

* **Input Contexts**
  * Required for intent matching
  * Must be active for intent to trigger
  * Helps maintain conversation flow
  * Example:
    ```
    User: "Tell me about checking account"
    [checking context activated]
    User: "What's the balance?"
    [checking context ensures this refers to checking account]
    ```

### 2. Follow-up Intents
* **Structure**
  * Parent-child relationship between intents

* **Features**
  * Automatic context setting
  * Only matched if parent intent is matched previously
  * Example:
    ```
    Parent: Order Pizza
    Follow-up: Size Selection
    Follow-up: Toppings Selection
    Follow-up: Confirm Order
    ```

## B. Fulfillment
* **What is it?**
  * Connects chatbot to other systems
  * Allows real-time data access
  * Makes responses dynamic

* **Process Flow**
  1. User asks something
  2. Bot understands request
  3. Checks external systems
  4. Gets current information
  5. Responds to user
