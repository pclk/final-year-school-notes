1.	What inspired you to start ProcoLink? 
I was completing my web application development school assignment, where we had built an e-commerce website. One feature we had, was an AI customer support chatbot built into the website, and I had the thought of the new market opportunities that were created due to advancements in GenAI. Thus, I went on a journey to see how we could utilize the developing GenAI technology into serving our community and for commercial applications.

2.	How did you end up joining the JumpStart Programme? How was the Programme like for you? 
I found out about the Jumpstart grant through my email newsletter. I saw the $10k grant and thought: "Wow, that must be a lot of money". I would imagine that the grant was going to be too competitive for me to receive, so the motivating factor was actually the experience of formulating a business idea and creating a simple prototype based of the research I've done into GenAI technology.

The programme expanded my horizons, and allowed me to network with many individuals, of which are keen to seek my services after taking a look at my product demo. I didn't expect the reception, because although I have been recognized as a technically capable individual, I didn't expect to be that much commotion about my product.

3.	An alumni company decided to work with you â€“ was that in the cards (i.e. was it part of the Jumpstart prog or it was sth unexpected?). How was that like for you? 
The alumni company Computer Guys, which is a very helpful and supportive group of people, was not part of the Jumpstart programme. It is rather a company which attended one of our SIT club interest group "NYP Technopreneurship club" event, called "NYP Link", where we got hundreds of students to attend a fireside session and promote the Jumpstart grant in SIT.

At the start of the event, as the founding exco of NYP Technopreneurship club, I had the privilege of presenting my company, ProcoLink, and our product to the audience as the first item of the event. There was a very pleasant reception, with audible gasps throughout our SIT community and even students from other schools.

After the event has concluded, Julian Ma, Founder and CEO of Computer Guys, which was present at the venue, has shared with us in person regarding the operational bottlenecks he was facing in his company, relating to IT Support and System Administration. We have talked much since then, built an Omni-channel Ticketing AI Helpdesk Solution "AIRES". I am also personally working together with them as a freelancer on separate technical projects which are production tested by real customers.

4.	How did you come up with the idea for an AI-powered helpdesk agent? Any personal anecdotes that made you want to improve helpdesk services? haha

Essentially, I have discussed with seniors who have been in the industry for a long time. Two of which, a brilliant salesperson and techie Kelvin Quee, as well as Sun Yuanxin, have discussed about the possibilities of the advancements in GenAI and especially the popularization of deep learning architectures like the transformer models coming into mainstream uses like Speech to Text, where we are able to clone voices with surprising amounts of quality. We began to test the ability of these models to clone Singaporean speech patterns, and it proved to be a success, earning recognition from Minister Chan Chun Sing and other industry partners outside of Computer Guys. We also have our dedicated big posters in SIT's Center of Innovation, showcasing our AIRES project.

There are definitely personal anecdotes, most of which are relating to availability based issues in the current helpdesk systems. Like most people, I am least productive in the afternoon and most productive in the morning and night. And so at night, if I were to encounter some issues that needed the helpdesk, I wouldn't be able to complete the task at all, and have to wait until the next working day. Our Voice AI System, once deployed as a helpdesk solution, will be able to run 24/7, where companies looking to expand globally would definitely appreciate this feature.

5.	Were there any particular experiences or insights that shaped your vision for ProcoLink?

Our vision for ProcoLink is to make Voice AI technology accessible to Singaporeans. I believe that there are major benefits to having leading in the Singaporean Voice AI space. Most of which are commercial reasons, but I think one insight that stands out, is the safety and education of Singaporeans against scams. Singapore is a prime target for scammers, and if we do not take control of Singaporean Voice AI technology, scammers are definitely going to steal a lot of money from Singaporeans. What we can do is to create the best Voice AI, act as a steward of this technology and introduce this technology publicly and safely.

6.	What were the biggest challenges you faced during the development of ProcoLink? 

We had a very tight timeline of 3 weeks to develop and create an Omni-channel Ticketing AI product that was highly indeterministic and unpredictable. We had to build not just our Voice AI System, but also a WhatsApp AI System, a Email AI system, as well as a Ticketing AI system, for a real client company with real consequences to ProcoLink's image, reputation and viability as a business. This is a project of an intensity probably never seen before in this school. We had a standup meeting everyday, keep a daily journal detailing everyone's progress and blockers, and a regular review with a Project Manager outside of this school. NYP has been incredibly helpful in exposing me to not only technical concepts, but also networks. However, nothing would have prepared me for such a intensive development cycle. I would do all again though, because it was one of those times where I felt the most alive, similar to how pianists would feel performing in a full stadium.

7.	Could you talk me through how this tech/business model works? 

At ProcoLink, we share our pricing at the start of every sale conversation to align ourselves and the client. SGD$0.95/connected call, and a optional Custom $1-3K setup fee for custom requests like voice cloning and system integration.

We also have Service level agreements:

8.	Lastly, any meaning behind the name ProcoLink?
Proco means to "ask", "request", "urge", "demand" in Latin. This refers to our client's customer's need to seek support, information or advice.

Link refers to our company's ability to link the client's customer's needs to the solution.

ProcoLink roughly translates to "AskLink".
