# It's best to define {{entities}} before adding {{training phrases}} to your {{intents}}, because the console will {{automatically annotate existing entities}}.

# Predictive ML models learns {{relationship}} between {{data and label}}, but GenAI models learn {{patterns}} in {{unstructured content}}.

# It is considered GenAI if the model output is {{Natural Language}}, {{Image}}, or {{Audio}}, but it is not considered GenAI if its {{Number}}, {{Discrete}}, {{Class}} or Probability.

# The inputs for {{Classical Supervised Learning}} & {{Unsupervised Learning}} are {{Training code}} and {{Labeled data}}, while the output is {{Predict}}, {{Classify}} or {{Cluster}}

# The inputs for {{GenAI}}, {{Semi-Supervised Learning}} and {{Unsupervised Learning}} are {{Training code}}, {{Labeled data}} and {{Unlabeled data}}, while the output is to {{generate new content}}, of which could be {{Text generation}}, {{Code generation}} or {{Image generation}}

# If you want to use GenAI with Google as a consumer, pick {{Gemini chat}}.

# If you want to use GenAI with Google as a developer, pick {{Foundational models}}.

# If you want to use GenAI with Google as a independent developer, and are looking to prototype, pick {{Google AI Studio}}.

# If you want to use GenAI with Google as a developer, and are looking for enterprise needs like {{privacy}}, {{data isolation}}, {{SLA}} and {{scaling}}, pick {{Google Cloud Vertex AI}}.

# The order of Google cloud vertex AI solutions from managed to DIY is {{Document AI}}, {{Vertex AI Search and Conversation}}, {{Model Garden}}, and {{Vertex AI Studio}}.

# Zero-shot is good for {{Q&A}}, {{Summarization}} and {{Continuation}}.

# Summarization is good for {{New articles}}, {{Research papers}}, {{Legal documents}}, {{Financial documents}}, {{Technical documents}} and {{Customer feedback}}.
