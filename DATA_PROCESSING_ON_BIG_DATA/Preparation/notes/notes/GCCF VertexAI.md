# Understanding Machine Learning and AI

## Introduction to Machine Intelligence

### The Human vs Computer Perception Gap
- Humans naturally understand contextual clues
  - Can recognize partially obscured objects
  - Understand scale variations of familiar items
  - Example: Snow-covered stop sign remains recognizable
  - Example: Oversized chair still understood as seating
- Computers lack intuitive understanding because:
  - No life experience to draw from
  - No natural learning process
  - Require explicit training for each scenario
  - Process information differently from humans
