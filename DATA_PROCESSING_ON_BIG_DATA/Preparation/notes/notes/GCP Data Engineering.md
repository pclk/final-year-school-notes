# Data Processing Patterns: EL, ELT, and ETL

## EL (Extract and Load)
- **Definition**: Simple data import process without transformation
- **Key Requirement**: Data MUST be clean and correct before processing

### Implementation Methods
1. **Cloud Storage to BigQuery**:
   - Direct REST API calls
   - No intermediate processing needed

2. **Triggering Mechanisms**:
   - Cloud Composer orchestration
   - Cloud Functions (event-driven)
   - BigQuery scheduled queries
   - BigQuery data transfer service

### Processing Modes
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Historical data loading
  - Scheduled log file processing
- **Near Real-Time Processing**:
  - Micro-batch implementation
  - Automatic triggering when new files arrive
  ```
  Flow: New file → Cloud Storage → Cloud Function → BigQuery job → Table append
  ```

## ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
- **Definition**: Raw data loaded first, transformations performed within target system

### Process Flow
1. Initial loading (similar to EL)
   ```
   File → Cloud Storage → Function → BigQuery load → Table append
   ```
2. Transformation options:
   - Views with data integrity checks (private dataset)
   - SQL queries with destination tables

### Use Case Example: Vision API Processing
- **Scenario**: Image upload and analysis
- **Process**:
  1. Image uploaded
  2. Vision API invoked
  3. JSON response received containing:
     - Text in image
     - Landmark detection
     - Logo identification
     - Object detection
- **Advantage**: Flexibility for future analysis
  - Store complete JSON response
  - Transform later based on specific needs
  - Example: Logo counting analysis

### Key Requirements
- Transformations must be SQL-expressible
- BigQuery SQL must support required operations (e.g., JSON parsing)

## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Definition**: Transformation occurs in intermediate service before loading
- **Example Architecture**:
  ```
  Source → Dataflow (transformation) → BigQuery (loading)
  ```

## Decision Factors
1. **Data Quality**:
   - Clean data → EL suitable
   - Dirty data → ETL/ELT needed

2. **Transformation Requirements**:
   - Known requirements → ETL
   - Unknown/evolving requirements → ELT

3. **Processing Capabilities**:
   - SQL-expressible transformations → ELT possible
   - Complex transformations → ETL needed

4. **Timing Requirements**:
   - Real-time needs
   - Batch processing
   - Near real-time (micro-batch)

5. **Storage Considerations**:
   - Private vs public datasets
   - Raw vs transformed data access
   - Storage costs and efficiency

## Best Practices
1. Always validate data cleanliness before choosing EL
2. Consider future transformation needs
3. Evaluate SQL capabilities for ELT
4. Plan for scalability and performance
5. Consider security and access patterns

# Data Quality

## Information Quality Characteristics

### 1. Valid
- Data must conform to defined business rules
- Critical for accurate business operations
- Example: Movie ticket pricing ($10 standard price)
  - Invalid transaction: $7 ticket price
  - Violates established business rule

### 2. Accurate
- Data must reflect objective truth
- Discrepancies between recorded data and reality
- Direct impact on business intelligence reliability

### 3. Complete
- All required data must be processed
- Missing data points create analysis gaps
- Affects comprehensive business understanding

### 4. Consistent
- Same operations should yield identical results
- Inconsistencies create trust issues in data
- Example: Same calculation producing different results across datasets
- Makes data-driven decision making unreliable

### 5. Uniform
- Data values in same column must maintain consistent meaning
- Non-uniformity leads to misinterpretation
- Affects data comparison and analysis accuracy

## Business Impact and Problem Detection

### Primary Motivations for Quality Control
1. Objective data quality improvement
2. Prevention of incorrect business decisions
3. Protection of business outcomes
4. Resource optimization (time, energy, money)

### Detection Methods
- Each quality characteristic requires specific detection approaches
- Problems must be identified before they can be addressed
- Regular monitoring and assessment needed

## ELT and BigQuery Solutions

### Duplicate Record Management
**Traditional Approach:**
- Separate transformation step
- Remove duplicates before analysis
- Additional processing overhead

**BigQuery Solution:**
- Utilize COUNT DISTINCT function
- Direct implementation in queries
- No intermediate transformation required
- More efficient processing

### Data Range Validation
**Implementation:**
- Direct handling in BigQuery
- No need for separate transformation pipeline
- Immediate validation during query execution

### Invalid Data Handling
**Strategy:**
1. Create filtered BigQuery views
2. Implement business rule validations in view definition
3. Restrict access to raw data
4. Grant access to validated views only

### Benefits of BigQuery Approach
1. Streamlined processing
2. Reduced transformation overhead
3. Immediate data quality improvements
4. Simplified access control
5. Better resource utilization

## Best Practices
1. Define clear data quality standards
2. Implement automated quality checks
3. Use BigQuery's native functions when possible
4. Create appropriate views for different use cases
5. Regular monitoring of data quality metrics
6. Document all data quality processes and rules

# How to carry out operations with BigQuery

## Filtering with Views

### Basic Filtering
- Use Views to filter out rows with quality issues
- Example: Remove negative quantities using WHERE clause
  ```sql
  WHERE quantity >= 0
  ```
- After GROUP BY operations, use HAVING clause to remove small sample sizes
  - Specifically removes groups with fewer than 10 records
  ```sql
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
  ```

### Handling NULL and BLANK Values
- NULL = absence of data (no value exists)
- BLANK = empty string ("") (value exists but is empty)
- Critical Considerations:
  - Decision needed on filtering approach:
    - Filter both NULLs and BLANKs simultaneously
    - Filter only NULLs
    - Filter only BLANKs
- Available Tools:
  - COUNTIF for counting non-null values
    ```sql
    COUNTIF(column IS NOT NULL)
    ```
  - IF statements to exclude specific values from calculations
    ```sql
    IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
    ```

## Data Accuracy

### Testing Against Known Values
- Order validation example:
  - Compute sub_total from quantity_ordered and item_price
    ```sql
    WHERE (quantity_ordered * item_price) = sub_total
    ```
  - Ensures mathematical accuracy of stored values
- Validation against acceptable values:
  - Use SQL IN for checking against canonical lists
    ```sql
    WHERE value IN (acceptable_value1, acceptable_value2, ...)
    ```

## Data Completeness

### Handling Missing Values
- Options:
  - Filter out missing values completely
  - Replace with reasonable substitute values
- SQL Functions for NULL handling:
  - NULLIF: Returns NULL if two expressions are equal
  - COUNTIF: Counts rows meeting a condition
  - COALESCE: Returns first non-NULL value in a list

### Data Gaps
- Use UNION to combine data and fill missing periods
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM dataset1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM dataset2
  ```
- Backfilling:
  - Automated process for:
    - Detecting missing data
    - Requesting missing data items
    - Filling data gaps
  - Available as feature in certain data transfer services

### Data Loading Integrity
- Verify file integrity using checksums:
  - Hash values
  - MD5 checksums
  - Ensures data hasn't been corrupted during transfer

## Consistency Issues

### Duplicate Detection
- COUNT vs COUNT DISTINCT comparison
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    COUNT(column) as total_rows,
    COUNT(DISTINCT column) as unique_values
  FROM table
  ```
  - Different results indicate presence of duplicates
- GROUP BY analysis
  ```sql
  SELECT column, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM table
  GROUP BY column
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  ```
  - Shows groups with duplicates

### Data Format Issues
- Extra characters in fields
  - Example: Timestamp inconsistencies
    - Some with timezone: "2023-01-01 10:00:00 UTC"
    - Some without: "2023-01-01 10:00:00"
  - Padded strings with extra spaces
- Solution: 
  - Use string functions for cleaning
    ```sql
    TRIM()
    RTRIM()
    LTRIM()
    ```

### Unit Consistency
- Problem: Mixed units in same column
  - Example: Length measurements
    - Some in centimeters
    - Some in millimeters
- Solutions:
  - SQL CAST to maintain data type consistency
    ```sql
    CAST(column AS FLOAT64)
    ```
  - SQL FORMAT() function to clearly indicate units
    ```sql
    FORMAT("%d cm", measurement)
    ```
  - Comprehensive documentation of:
    - Unit standards
    - Conversion factors
    - Data validation rules

## Key Takeaway
- BigQuery SQL provides robust toolset for:
  - Identifying data quality issues
  - Cleaning problematic data
  - Ensuring data consistency
  - Maintaining data integrity
- Proper use of these tools is essential for reliable data analysis

# ETL vs ELT in Data Processing

# Building Dataflow Pipeline in Code

## Basic Pipeline Structure

### Linear Pipeline Flow
- Pipelines begin with an input PCollection (data container)
- Multiple PTransforms (processing steps) are chained together
- Each transform takes input and produces output PCollections
- Final output is typically stored in a named PCollection variable

### Language-Specific Implementation Patterns
- Python uses pipe operators (`|`) to chain transforms together
- Java implements the same concept using `.apply()` method calls
- Both approaches achieve identical pipeline flow and functionality

## Branching Patterns

### Multiple Output Streams
- Single input PCollection can feed multiple transform chains
- Each branch processes data independently
- Output from each branch stored in separate named PCollections
- Enables parallel processing paths within single pipeline

## Pipeline Components

### Sources (Input)
- Initialize pipelines by creating first PCollection
- Common sources include:
  - Cloud Storage text files
  - BigQuery tables
  - Pub/Sub topics
  - Database queries

### Transforms (Processing)
- Apply data processing operations to PCollections
- Examples include:
  - FlatMap: one-to-many row transformations
  - Map: one-to-one transformations
  - GroupBy: data aggregation
  - Combine: data reduction

### Sinks (Output)
- Final destination for processed data
- Common sinks include:
  - Cloud Storage files
  - BigQuery tables
  - Database tables
  - Pub/Sub topics

## Execution Configuration

### Local vs Cloud Execution
- Default runner executes pipeline locally
- Dataflow runner executes in Google Cloud
- Configuration controlled through pipeline options
- Parameters typically specified via command line arguments

### Best Practices
- Avoid hardcoding configuration values
- Use command-line parameters for flexibility
- Enable easy switching between local and cloud execution
- Implement proper parameter validation

## Pipeline Lifecycle

### Initialization
1. Create pipeline object with desired options
2. Configure source to create initial PCollection
3. Define transform chain for data processing

### Processing
1. Data flows through defined transform chain
2. Each transform processes input and produces output
3. Branching allows parallel processing paths

### Completion
1. Final results written to specified sink
2. Pipeline automatically terminates for batch processing
3. Streaming pipelines continue running until manually stopped

## Example Pipeline Flow
```plaintext
Input Source
    → Transform_1 (data cleaning)
        → Transform_2 (data enrichment)
            → Transform_3 (aggregation)
                → Output Sink
```

This structured approach enables:
- Clear data processing workflows

# Transforming data with PTransforms

## Core Concepts of Data Transformation

### Basic Transformation Types

#### Map Operations
- Creates a strict one-to-one relationship between input and output elements
- Example: Converting words to their lengths
  ```
  Input: "dog" → Output: 3
  Input: "cat" → Output: 3
  Input: "elephant" → Output: 8
  ```
- Perfect for simple, direct transformations where each input produces exactly one output

#### FlatMap Operations
- Handles one-to-many relationships between input and output elements
- Particularly useful when a single input might generate multiple outputs
- Uses Python generators with 'yield' to produce multiple outputs efficiently
- Example: Finding word occurrences in text
  ```
  Input: "The dog sees another dog"
  Output: ["dog", "dog"] (when searching for "dog")
  ```

#### ParDo Operations
- Most versatile transformation type in Apache Beam
- Supports complex processing logic with multiple outputs
- Common use cases:
  - Data cleaning and normalization
  - Field extraction and restructuring
  - Format conversion
  - Complex calculations
  - Filtering and validation

### Implementation Requirements

#### DoFn Characteristics
- Must be fully serializable for distributed processing
- Needs to be idempotent (same input always produces same output)
- Required to be thread-safe for parallel execution
- Should handle edge cases gracefully

#### Best Practices for Implementation
- Keep transformations atomic and focused
- Document transformation logic clearly
- Include error handling for unexpected inputs
- Consider performance implications of complex operations
- Test with various input scenarios

## Advanced Transformation Features

### Multiple Output Handling
- ParDo can output to multiple PCollections simultaneously
- Useful for data splitting and categorization
- Example:
  ```
  Input: Numerical values
  Output1: Values below threshold
  Output2: Values above threshold
  ```

### Data Type Considerations
- Input and output types should be clearly defined
- Type consistency should be maintained throughout the pipeline
- Common transformations:
  - String to structured records
  - Raw data to formatted output
  - Complex objects to simple types

### Performance Optimization
- Keep transformations lightweight when possible
- Batch operations where appropriate
- Consider memory usage in transformation design
- Use appropriate data structures for efficiency

## Practical Applications
